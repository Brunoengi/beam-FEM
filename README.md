- Under development

This repository contains a computational library for calculating internal forces in beams using the Finite Element Method (FEM).
The project is focused on structural analysis, allowing the evaluation of shear forces, bending moments, rotations, and deflections along beam elements.

The implementation is designed to be modular, extensible, and suitable for both academic studies and engineering applications.
